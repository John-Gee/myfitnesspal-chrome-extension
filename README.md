# myfitnesspal-chrome-extension
Google chrome extension to allow a better user experience with myfitnesspal website

Have you ever feel frustrated at some of the options in myfitnesspal?

If yes, then this if for you!

This extension allows you to override certain parameters of myfitnesspal.
You can specify by the gram how much protein, fat or carbs you want, no more percentage nonsense.
You can cycle calories each day of the week, no more reason to eat the same amount every day!
(Carb cycling anyone?)

The extension now also support net carbs, albeit in a limited way. You first have to get myfitnesspal to show you fiber as a column, the extension will then do the subtraction. Alas myfitnesspal does not show sugar alcohols so it's not real net carbs... Not much I can do for this sorry.


If you are like me, I bet you got irritated many times adding food to your diary and then realizing that you were past midnight and therefore it added it to the next day's list...
To bypass this, the extension has the ability to add food to the current date and not let the myfitnesspal site figure it out once you click "Add Checked".

The extension also adds a derived calories column, that's the extension calculating calories based on the macros provided. If there is a big discrepancy between the calories offered by myfitnesspal and the derived ones you can guess that there is an issue somewhere in the data.

Feel free to give comments or ask for other features.

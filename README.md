# myfitnesspal-chrome-extension
Google chrome extension to allow a better user experience with myfitnesspal website

An extension for the MyFitnessPal website
Have you ever feel frustrated at some of the options in myfitnesspal?

If yes, then this if for you!

This extension allows you to override certain parameters of myfitnesspal.
You can specify by the gram how much protein, far or carb you want, no more percentage nonsense.
Or you can cycle calories each day of the week, no more reason to eat the same amount every day!
(Carb cycling anyone?)

The extension also somewhat add support for NetCarbs, which in this case means TotalCarbs minus Fiber, Sugar Alcohols are not supported as they are not given by MyFitnessPal
